# Foster Docs

**Foster Docs**, short for _Foster Documents_, is a cloud-based, mobile-ready, foster family document and communication platform.  The need for Foster Docs arose from the inefficiencies often felt when managing paper-based documents and submitting monthly reports.  Some of the struggles Foster Docs hopes to address are:

  - Foster child profiles
    - All DHS / FFA intake, releases, medical, etc. forms.
  - Purchase/reimbursement tracking
  - Monthly report generation / submission
  - Visitation scheduling
  - Scheduled Tasks & Events
  - Notifications
    - Changes to schedule
    - Documents / reponse needed

The project is currently in development, and not ready for any sort of production or external testing.
